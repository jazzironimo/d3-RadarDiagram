# d3-RadarDiagram
Visualisation of numerical data regarding text simplification.

[Preview](https://rawgit.com/jazzironimo/d3-RadarDiagram/README-edits/visualization.html)

## What is this project?
A thing I did for the larger project TeCST (which, in turn, is part of Diginclude) during the summer of 2017. TeCST is a tool which analyses a text and determines how easy it is to read, as well as giving suggestions on how to improve it. This diagram transforms numerical data into something more comprehensible. The green-colored part in the middle of the circle is the golden standard - thus, it should be as close to this part as possible.

Final product in use can be found [here](http://www.ida.liu.se/projects/scream/webapp/).

## Project Status - Finished
The code is functional and I don't intend to work on this anymore (for now).

## TeCST Target Audience
TeCST is for anyone that would like to simplify their texts. At the moment, as it is still in development, it is targeted more towards web editors and authors of organizational/governmental texts which may be difficlt for immigrants to understand.

Worth noting is that, currently, it is exclusively in Swedish :)

## Other
Created with the d3 v.4 library.

Special thanks to my supervisor Daniel Fahlborg for the fine tuning and final tweaks to make it work.
